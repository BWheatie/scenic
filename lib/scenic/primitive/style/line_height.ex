defmodule Scenic.Primitive.Style.LineHeight do
  @moduledoc """
  Adjust the vertical spacing of lines of text in a single block.

  ### Data Format

  This is expressed as a percentage of the size of the font. So a value of `1.2`
  would mean 120% the font size as the spacing from baseline to baseline.

  The behavior of this style is intended to be very similar to the `line_height` CSS
  style.

  Example:

  ```elixir
  graph
    |> text( "Some Text\\r\\nMore Text", line_height: 1.1 )
  ```

  The default if `:line_height` is not specified is `1.2`. Set this style if
  you want to override it.


  ### Note

  This style is not actually represented in the low-level `Scenic.Script` format.
  Instead it is a hint that is processed when a graph is "compiled" into a script.
  Essentially it instructs the graph compiler to automatically apply transforms to
  each line in a multi-line text string that separate out the lines of text from
  each other.
