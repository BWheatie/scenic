defmodule Scenic.Primitive.Style.Paint.Stream do
  @moduledoc """
  Fill a primitive with an image or bitmap from Scenic.Assets.Stream

  ## Format

  `{:stream, key}`

  Fill with the static image indicated by `key`

  This example fills a rect with the contents of the `"color_cycle"` stream.
  When the source of the stream updates the bitmap it contains, the rect's
  fill will automatically be updated.
 
  ```elixir
  Graph.build()
    |> rect( {100, 50}, fill: {:stream, "color_cycle"} )
  ```
