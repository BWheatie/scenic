  ## Overview

  Scenes are the core of the UI model.

  A `Scene` has three jobs.

  1. Maintain any state specific to that part of your application.
  1. Build and maintain a graph of UI primitives that gets drawn
  to the screen.
  2. Handle input and events.

  ### A brief aside

  Before saying anything else I want to emphasize that the rest of your
  application, meaning device control logic, sensor reading / writing,
  services, whatever, does not need to have anything to do with Scenes.

  In many cases I recommend treating those as separate GenServers in their
  own supervision trees that you maintain. Then your Scenes would query or send
  information to/from them via cast or call messages.

  Part of the point of using Elixir/Erlang/OTP is separating this sort of
  logic into independent trees. That way, an error in one part of your
  application does not mean the rest of it will fail.

  ## Scenes

  Scenes are the core of the UI model. A scene consists of one or more
  graphs, and a set of event handlers and filters to deal with user input
  and other messages.

  Think of a scene as being a little like an HTML page. HTML pages have:

  * Structure (the DOM)
  * Logic (Javascript)
  * Links to other pages.

  A Scene has:

  * Structure (graphs),
  * Logic (event handlers and filters)
  * Transitions to other scenes. Well... it can request the [`ViewPort`](overview_viewport.html)
  to go to a different scene.

  Your application is a collection of scenes that are in use at different times. There
  is only ever **one** scene showing in a [`ViewPort`](overview_viewport.html) at a given
  time. However, scenes can instantiate components, effectively embedding their graphs
  inside the main one. More on that below.


  ### [Graphs](Scenic.Graph.html)

  Each scene should maintain at least one graph. You can build graphs
  at compile time, or dynamically while your scene is running. Building
  them at compile time has two advantages

    1. Performance: It is clearly faster to build the graph once during
    build time than to build it repeatedly during runtime.
    2. Error checking: If your graph has an error in it, it is much
    better to have it stop compilation than cause an error during runtime.

  Example of building a graph during compile time:

      @graph Scenic.Graph.build(font_size: 24)
        |> button({"Press Me", :button_id}, translate: {20, 20})

  Rather than having a single scene maintain a massive graph of UI,
  graphs can reference graphs in other scenes.

  On a typical screen of UI, there is one scene
  that is the root. Each control, is its own scene process with
  its own state. These child scenes can in turn contain other
  child scenes. This allows for strong code reuse, isolates knowledge
  and logic to just the pieces that need it, and keeps the size of any
  given graph to a reasonable size. For example, the
  handlers of a check-box scene don't need to know anything about
  how a slider works, even though they are both used in the same
  parent scene. At best, they only need to know that they
  both conform to the `Component.Input` behavior, and can thus
  query or set each others value. Though it is usually
  the parent scene that does that.

  The application developer is responsible for building and
  maintaining the scene's graph. It only enters the world of the
  `ViewPort` when you call `push_graph`. Once you have called
  `push_graph`, that graph is sent to the drivers and is out of your
  immediate control. You update that graph by calling `push_graph`
  again.

  ## Scene State

  Scenes are just a specialized form of `GenServer`. This means they can react to messages
  and can have state. However, scene state is a bit like socket state in `Phoenix` in that
  It has a strict format, but you can add anything you want into its `:assigns` map.


  #### Multiple Graphs

  Any given scene can maintain multiple graphs and multiple draw scripts.
  They are identified from each other with an id that you attach.

  Normally when you use push_graph, you don't attach an ID. In that case
  the scene's pid is used as the id.

  ### Communications

  Scenes are specialized GenServers. As such, they communicate with each other
  (and the rest of your application) through messages. You can receive
  messages with the standard `handle_info`, `handle_cast`, `handle_call` callbacks just
  like any other scene.

  Scenes have two new event handling callbacks that you can *optionally* implement. These
  are about user input vs UI events.


  ## Input vs. Events

  Input is data generated by the drivers and sent up to the scenes
  through the `Scenic.ViewPort`. There is a limited set of input types and
  they are standardized so that the drivers can be built independently
  of the scenes. Input follows certain rules about which scene receives them.

  Events are messages that one scene generates for consumption
  by other scenes. For example, a `Scenic.Component.Button` scene would
  generate a `{:click, msg}` event that is sent to its parent
  scene.

  You can generate any message you want, however, the standard
  component libraries follow certain patterns to keep things sensible.

  ## Input Handling

  You handle incoming input events by adding `c:handle_input/3` callback
  functions to your scene. Each `c:handle_input/3` call passes in the input
  message itself, an input context struct, and your scene's state. You can then
  take the appropriate actions, including generating events (below) in response.

  Under normal operation, input that is not position dependent
  (keys, window events, more...) is sent to the root scene. Input
  that does have a screen position (cursor_pos, cursor button
  presses, etc.) is sent to the scene that contains the
  graph that was hit.

  Your scene can "capture" all input of a given type so that
  it is sent to itself instead of the default scene for that type.
  this is how a text input field receives the key input. First,
  the user selects that field by clicking on it. In response
  to the cursor input, the text field captures text input (and
  maybe transforms its graph to show that it is selected).

  Captured input types should be released when no longer
  needed so that normal operation can resume.

  The input messages are passed on to a scene's parent if
  not processed.

  ## Event Filtering

  In response to input, (or anything else... a timer perhaps?),
  a scene can generate an event (any term), which is sent backwards
  up the tree of scenes that make up the current aggregate graph.

  In this way, a `Scenic.Component.Button` scene can generate a `{:click, msg}`
  event that is sent to its parent. If the parent doesn't
  handle it, it is sent to that scene's parent. And so on until the
  event reaches the root scene. If the root scene also doesn't handle
  it then the event is dropped.

  To handle events, you add `c:handle_event/3` functions to your scene.
  This function handles the event, and stops its progress backwards
  up the graph. It can handle it and allow it to continue up the
  graph. Or it can transform the event and pass the transformed
  version up the graph.

  You choose the behavior by returning either

      {:cont, msg, state}

  or

      {:halt, state}

  Parameters passed in to `c:handle_event/3` are the event itself, a
  reference to the originating scene (which you can to communicate
  back to it), and your scene's state.

  A pattern I'm using is to handle an event at the filter and stop
  its progression. It also generates and sends a new event to its
  parent. I do this instead of transforming and continuing when
  I want to change the originating scene.


  ## No children

  There is an optimization you can use. If you know for certain that your component
  will not attempt to use any components, you can set `has_children` to `false` like this.

      use Scenic.Component, has_children: false

  Setting `has_children` to `false` means the scene won't create
  a dynamic supervisor for this scene, which saves some resources and imporoves startup
  time.

  For example, the Button component sets `has_children` to `false`.

  Invoked when the `Scene` receives input from a driver.

  Input is messages sent directly from a driver, usually based on some action by the user.
  This is opposed to "events", which are generated by other scenes.

  When input arrives at a scene, you can consume it, or pass it along to the scene above
  you in the ViewPort's supervision structure.

  To consume the input and have processing stop afterward, return either a `{:halt, ...}` or
  `{:noreply, ...}` value. They are effectively the same thing.

  To allow the scene's parent to process the input, return `{:cont, input, state, ...}`. Note
  that you can pass along the input unchanged or transform it in the process if you wish.

  The callback supports all the return values of the
  [`init`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html#c:handle_cast/2)
  callback in [`Genserver`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html).

  In addition to the normal return values defined by GenServer, a `Scene` can

  Invoked when the `Scene` is started.

  `args` is the argument term you passed in via config or ViewPort.set_root.

  `options` is a list of information giving you context about the environment
  the scene is running in. If an option is not in the list, then it should be
  treated as nil.
    * `:viewport` - This is the pid of the ViewPort that is managing this dynamic scene.
      It will be not set, or nil, if you are managing the Scene in a static
      supervisor yourself.
    * `:styles` - This is the map of styles that your scene can choose to inherit
      (or not) from its parent scene. This is typically used by a child control that
      wants to visually fit into its parent's look.
