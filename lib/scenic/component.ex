defmodule Scenic.Component do
  @moduledoc """
  A Component is simply a Scene that is optimized to be referenced by another scene.

  All you need to do to create a Component is call

      use Scenic.Component

  instead of

      use Scenic.Scene

  At the top of your module definition.

  ## Standard Components

  Scenic includes a small number of standard components that you can simply reuse in your
  scenes. These were chosen to be in the main library because a) they are used frequently,
  and b) their use promotes a certain amount of "common" look and feel.

  All of these components are typically added/modified via the helper functions in the
  [`Scenic.Components`](Scenic.Components.html) module.

  * [`Button`](Scenic.Component.Button.html) a simple button.
  * [`Checkbox`](Scenic.Component.Input.Checkbox.html) a checkbox input field.
  * [`Dropdown`](Scenic.Component.Input.Dropdown.html) a dropdown / select input field.
  * [`RadioGroup`](Scenic.Component.Input.RadioGroup.html) a group of radio button inputs.
  * [`Slider`](Scenic.Component.Input.Slider.html) a slider input.
  * [`TextField`](Scenic.Component.Input.TextField.html) a text / password input field.
  * [`Toggle`](Scenic.Component.Input.Toggle.html) an on/off toggle input.

  ## Other Components

  For completeness, Scenic also includes the following standard components. They are used
  by the components above, although you are free to use them as well if they fit your needs.

  * [`Caret`](Scenic.Component.Input.Caret.html) the vertical, blinking, caret line in a text field.
  * [`RadioButton`](Scenic.Component.Input.RadioButton.html) a single radio button in a radio group.

  ## Verifiers

  One of the main differences between a Component and a Scene is the two extra callbacks
  that are used to verify incoming data. Since Components are meant to be reused, you
  should do some basic validation that the data being set up is valid, then provide
  feedback if it isn't.

  ## Optional: Named Component

  Whether you override one or more message handlers, like `handle_info/2`,
  you might want to use registered name as
  [`Process.dest()`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Process.html?#t:dest/0).
  For this to be possible, you might pass `name:` keyword argument in a call
  to `use Scenic.Component`.

      use Scenic.Component, name: __MODULE__

  Once passed, it limits the usage of this particular component to
  a single instance, because two processes cannot be registered under the same name.

  ## Optional: No Children

  There is an optimization you can use. If you know for certain that your component
  will not attempt to use any components, you can set `has_children` to `false` like this.

      use Scenic.Component, has_children: false

  Setting `has_children` to `false` this will do two things. First, it won't create
  a dynamic supervisor for this scene, which saves some resources.

  For example, the Button component sets `has_children` to `false`.

  This option is available for any Scene, not just components
